    <p>
      In 2019, I built my first computer. My dad helped me find the parts and I put the computer together while following a YouTube video. Recently
      (2023), I decided to upgrade my PC. I chose my own parts and put it together without any help. Here is how my setup evolved over the years.

    </figure>

        <img id = "screen"  src = "img/screen.gif" style = "float:right" width = 160 height = 320>
        My recent build includes a <b>Ryzen 7 7700x</b> CPU and the <b>GTX 3060</b> with <b>32GB of RAM</b> in the <b>Lian Li O11 Dynamic
        EVO case</b>. My aunt gifted me the strimers, which I encountered a lot of trouble installing because I was missing USB ports. My AIO cooler
        is also the <b>Lian Li Galahad 360mm CPU cooler</b>. The case fans are the <b>Lian Li SL120 </b> fans, which were very easy to install since
        you could connect multiple fans together, eliminating the need for a huge wad of cables! I installed a mini USB monitor (the <b>WOWNOVA 5in
        Computer Temp Monitor</b>) in my PC case for aesthetics. The nice thing about this monitor is that it doesn't use up any ports on your video card.
        I ended up changing the case fans and the AIO cooler later on, which is why my current computer looks different from the image above.
