      My name is Casey Ye, a current student with a strong passion for keyboards and PC building! I started this hobby during 2019, when
      COVID started and everyone was in lockdown. I had broken my laptop and built my very first desktop computer. It was a good investment,
      especially considering the amount of time I would be spending in front of the computer. Not only did this experience introduce me to
      custom keyboard building, but it allowed me to better communicate with other people and find like-minded people.
    </p>
    <p> <img id = "soldering_pic" src="img/soldering.jpg"  style="float:right; width:200px; height:300px;">
      After taking many computer programming courses in high school, I realized my initial career plan of becoming a software engineer (inspired
      by a family member) wasn't cut out for me. I lacked the confidence in my code and felt like I depended on too many people to produce code
      that I would be proud to call my own. Building keyboards and computers and working with the actual hardware components gave me the confidence
      I was looking for when exploring career paths. This hobby is what lead me to believe that I would be a good electrical engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've always had a passion fo helping and educating other people. I hope that with this website, I can share my keyboard and PC building
      journey to a wider audience and inspire other people, the same way this hobby inspired and help me find what I want to do with my future! <br><br>

        My recent build includes a <b>Ryzen 7 7700x</b> CPU and the <b>GTX 3060</b> with <b>32GB of RAM</b> in the <b>Lian Li O11 Dynamic
        EVO case</b>. My aunt gifted me the strimers, which I encountered a lot of trouble installing because I was missing USB ports. My AIO cooler
        is also the <b>Lian Li Galahad 360mm CPU cooler</b>. The case fans are the <b>Lian Li SL120 </b> fans, which were very easy to install since
        you could connect multiple fans together, eliminating the need for a huge wad of cables! I installed a mini USB monitor (the <b>WOWNOVA 5in
        Computer Temp Monitor</b>) in my PC case for aesthetics. The nice thing about this monitor is that it doesn't use up any ports on your video card.
        I ended up changing the case fans and the AIO cooler later on, which is why my current computer looks different from the image above.

      "Casey helped me modify a prebuilt keyboard that I had bought off of Amazon a little over a year ago. I gave them the keyboard and some new switches,
      and the final product turned out great! I continue to use it to this day. The process was great to see, as they made sure to show me updates along the way
      with pictures and videos. Highly recommend!" - E. Chan

      "Casey built a keyboard for me. They helped me choose what style I wanted, including casing, switches, etc. The keyboard is super nice with good thocks
      &#128525;. Highly recommend getting a keyboard custom built by them." - M. Wang

      "I really enjoy using the keyboard for work and for gaming. The keys are very responsive. There is no staining on my white keyboard and it shows no sign of
      wear and tear after a year of continuous use. The color combination of white and blue lights are very appealing!" - A. Ye

      I can help find parts, mod switches, stabilizers, and prebuilt keyboards, and making fully custom boards. I am also open to repairing keyboards. Price of the
      service is negotiable but customer must be willing to pay the price of at least the materials (casing, switches, Krytox, films, etc).
