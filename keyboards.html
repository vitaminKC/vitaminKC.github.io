      Ever since I had built my first computer, I had been itching to make something else. That's when I stumbled into the world of custom
      mechanical keyboards. I invested hours in watching other people being able to build something practical and so necessary in the current
      day and age. That's when I modded my first keyboard. The feeling of transforming the original typing experience of the keyboard felt very
      rewarding. I had finally found something that I was truly passionate about.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been comissioned to build many keyboards for people and it's something I love doing! I have made full builds for people, done the mundane
      task of lubing switches, modding stabilizers, helping people create their perfect keyboard build, and programmed their keyboards using VIA. Through
      this process of making keyboards, I taught myself how to solder switch joints, a basic engineering skill. As part of my mission to teach people about
      keyboards, I plan to make a guide on building keyboards! <br>

      This year, I built the Zoom78, which has become my daily driver. I modded some DangKeebs Strawberry Milk tactile switches. This is now my first and only
      tactile keyboard. What I was most excited about the build was the LCD screen. This was also the most complicated part of the build because of how small and
      delicate the ribbon cables were.
